<H3> About Me </H3>
<pre>
My name is Michael Kopriva and I am a Senior at Shippensburg University. I was
originally a computer science major, but decided to switch to MIS at the start
of my sophomore year.
</pre>
<pre>
I am from Lititz, Pennsylvania. It is about an hour and 15 minutes east of here. 
It was voted the coolest small town in America back in 2013.
</pre>
<pre>
I have a younger sister who is currently a sophomore at Kutztown University. I
also have a small dog named Sophie and she is a mix between Shih Tzu and Bichon
Frise.
</pre>
<pre>
I love being healthy and active. I am very passionate about weight lifting and 
bodybuilding. In my free time I am probably at the gym. If not, other things I
enjoy are cars, animals (dogs in particular), cooking, playing video games, and 
playing sports (either football or basketball).
